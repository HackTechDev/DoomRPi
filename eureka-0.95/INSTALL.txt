COMPILING Eureka
================

Dependencies:

1. C++ compiler (GNU's G++) and associated tools
   packages: g++ binutils

2. GNU make
   package: make

3. FLTK 1.3 
   website: http://www.fltk.org/
   package: libfltk1.3-dev

   You may also need: libxft-dev
                      libxinerama-dev
                      libjpeg-dev

4. zlib
   website: http://www.zlib.net/
   package: zlib1g-dev

5. XDG Utils
   (only needed for Linux, to install the desktop and icon files)
   package: xdg-utils


Assuming all those dependencies are met, then the following shell
command will build the Eureka binary. (The '>' is just the prompt)

   > make


Some systems may need additional CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS in order
to find the required libraries (especially FLTK).  For example,
the following is reported to work for Gentoo Linux:

   CFLAGS  += -I/usr/include/fltk-1
   LDFLAGS += -L/usr/lib64/fltk-1/



INSTALLING Eureka
=================

First make sure the Eureka binary was compiled successfully.

Then become root (via the 'sudo' or 'su' command) and enter the
following shell command:

   > make install

That will install the eureka binary, definition files for various
games and source ports, and the desktop and icon files.



SETTING UP Eureka
=================

Eureka requires an IWAD file from one of the supported games, for
example "doom2.wad".  Eureka will look for IWADs when it starts up,
but if it cannot find any then the 'Manage Wads' dialog will open
and you can browse for an IWAD file there, which will be remembered
for next time.

Places where Eureka looks for IWADs:

  1. The "iwads" directory in Eureka's home directory.  In Linux
     this will be "~/.eureka/iwads".  It is created automatically
     the first time Eureka is run (though there is no harm in
     creating it yourself).

  2. (a) In Linux: /usr/share/games/doom
     (b) In Windows: C:\DOOM and C:\DOOM2

  3. If you run Eureka from the command line and have the DOOMWADDIR
     environment variable set, then Eureka should find it in that
     directory.

  4. If running from the command line, Eureka will look in the current
     directory for the IWAD.

  5. You can specify the IWAD file directly with the --iwad option.
