Visplane Explorer TODO
======================

+  Hexen support
   -  check for BEHAVIOR lump
   -  visplane limit raised to 160
   -  check Quasar's spot in Bright Crucible (MAP06) :-

      "Standing near the left hand side of the map backing into the
      southern corner from a medial position relative to the
      indentation in the wall near the left-side entrance to the
      location of D'Sparil's Heart, and looking out into the swamp"

+  File / Save Image

+  new 'Combined' mode : show MAX(vis, draw, solid) and which one

+  get sector height as if from a player (32x32 bbox)
   - test all lines which intersect bbox
   - generate a blockmap for faster testing


+  mode to show seg splits

+  validate a loaded map (e.g. vertex number out of range)

+  ability to draw a box (with LMB) and only those tiles get processed

+  command to open all closed doors (etc)
   - look for tagged closed sectors and D1/DR door lines


-  allow zooming in more

-  determine when a tile is completely in void -- no need to create it
   (perhaps create a bitmap of all 64x64 areas which are void)

-  support -file and -warp options, allow -warp to be a number

-  View / Go to Location


-  automatically switch to visplane mode when map is loaded

-  prevent ESCAPE key from quitting

-  sys_debug.cc/h with SYS_ASSERT() macro

-  handle fatal errors / uncaught exceptions better


IDEA:  have a Memory menu : four or five settings

WISH:  multi-threaded processing
