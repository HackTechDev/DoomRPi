COMPILING
=========

Dependencies:

1. GNU C++ compiler and associated tools
   packages: g++ binutils

2. GNU make
   package: make

3. FLTK 1.3 
   website: http://www.fltk.org/
   package: libfltk1.3-dev

   You may also need: libxft-dev
                      libxinerama-dev
                      libjpeg-dev
                      zlib1g-dev

4. XDG Utils
   (only needed for Linux, to install the desktop and icon files)
   package: xdg-utils


Assuming all those dependencies are met, then the following shell
command will build the visplane-explorer binary.
(The '>' is just the prompt)

   > make -f Makefile.unix


Some systems may need additional CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS in order
to find the required libraries (especially FLTK).  For example,
the following is reported to work for Gentoo Linux:

   CFLAGS  += -I/usr/include/fltk-1
   LDFLAGS += -L/usr/lib64/fltk-1/


INSTALLATION
============

First make sure the binary was compiled successfully.

Then become root (via the 'sudo' or 'su' command) and enter the
following shell command:

   > make -f Makefile.unix install

That will install the visplane-explorer binary and the desktop
and icon files.
