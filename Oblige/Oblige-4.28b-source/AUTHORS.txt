NOTES:

OBLIGE was written from scratch. It does not contain any code
from SLIGE (by David Chess) or from any other random level
generator.

The cave algorithm used in OBLIGE was described by Jim Babcock
in his article: "Cellular Automata Method for Generating
Random Cave-Like Levels".

The random number generator used by OBLIGE is the Mersenne Twister,
with code by Richard J. Wagner / 15 May 2003 / rjwagner@writeme.com
based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus.

OBLIGE uses the FLTK widget library (http://www.fltk.org)
