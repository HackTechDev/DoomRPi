Synopsis
--------

::

  input-linux-mouse: [<mousetype>] [,<file>] [,[b<bauds>][r<rts>][d<dtr>]]


Description
-----------


This input opens a file (usually a device file or pipe) and reads
mouse protocol data from it. 


Options
-------

:p:`mousetype`
    Indicates what type of mouse is attached.  The following
    types are supported:

    - ``ms``, ``Microsoft`` : Two button Microsoft compatible mice.

    - ``ms3``, ``IntelliMouse``, ``mman+`` : Serial Intellimouse or
      compatible. Supports four buttons for mice like the Logitech
      MouseMan+.

    - ``MouseSystems``, ``msc`` : MouseSystems compatible (used in
      most 3-button mice).

    - ``Logitech``, ``logi`` : 	Used in older Logitech serial mice.

    - ``mm``, ``MMSeries`` : 	MM series mice.

    - ``Sun`` :	Sun mice. The protocol is the same as 'msc' protocol
      except it used only 3 bytes per packet.

    - ``MouseMan``, ``mman`` : 	MouseMan protocol.

    - ``BusMouse``, ``bm`` : Non-PS/2 busmice.

    - ``LinuxUSB``, ``lnxusb`` : IMPS2 that doesn't choke on USB (no
      init attempted).

    - ``ps2``, ``PS/2`` : PS/2 mice (most non-serial mice use this
      protocol)

    - ``imps2``, ``IMPS/2`` : PS/2 IntelliMouse and compatible (not
      USB, see lnxusb for that.)

    - ``mmanps2``, ``MouseManPlusPS/2`` : PS/2 Logitech MouseMan+ and
      compatible.

    Most of the strings supported by GPM, SVGAlib and XFree can be
    specified.  If you find one that isn't, please report.

    The special value ``auto`` tells `input-linux-mouse` to read
    `~/.ggi/input/linux-mouse`, and if that fails,
    `$sysconfdir/ggi/input/linux-mouse`.  If none of the two files are
    found, `input-linux-mouse` tries to auto-detect the mouse, and as
    a last resort uses the mouse information specified in
    `/etc/vga/libvga.config`.

:p:`file`
    The file to read mouse protocol data from; defaults to
    `/dev/mouse`.

:p:`baud`
    Baud rate of mouse device.

:p:`rts`
    Turns off RTS if set to ``0``; turns RTS on if
    set to a number greater than 0.

:p:`dtr`
    Turns off DTR if set to ``0``; turns DTR on if set
    to a number greater than 0.


Features
--------

- Generates evPtr* events.


Files
-----

`~/.ggi/input/linux-mouse` and `$sysconfdir/ggi/input/linux-mouse`
consists of the following entries::

    mouse mousetype
    mdev file

where :p:`mousetype` and :p:`file` has the same semantics as the
invocation options of the same names.
