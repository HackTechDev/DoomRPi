GGI error codes are of the form GGI_* and are guaranteed to be
negative (except GGI_OK of course, which is guaranteed to be zero).

The following error codes are defined:

.nb
.nf
GGI_OK                  0     /* All is well */

GGI_ENOMEM            -20     /* Out of memory */

                                 was not previously allocated */
