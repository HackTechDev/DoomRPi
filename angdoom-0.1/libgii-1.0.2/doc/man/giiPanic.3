.SH NAME
\fBgiiPanic\fR : Exit LibGII programs for fatal errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nb
.nf
#include <ggi/gii.h>

int giiPanic(const char * format, ...);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBggiPanic(3)\fR shuts down the application, closing all inputs, with
\f(CWprintf(3)\fR-style reporting to stderr, taking a format string and
any additional variables.

\fBgiiPanic\fR should only be used by usermode programs when something is
really screwed, and they do not know what to do. The same applies for
libraries, but might be used in rare situations such as corruption of
critical data structures.
.SH EXAMPLES
An unrecoverable error:

.nb
.nf
if (my_important_struct->magic != MAGIC) {
  giiPanic("Fatal error: magic corrupted\en");
}
.fi
