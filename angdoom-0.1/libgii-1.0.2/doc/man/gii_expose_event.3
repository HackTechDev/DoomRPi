.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
If an application loses the focus and is not physically displayed
(e.g. console switching, iconifying), it may be stopped. Some targets
may implement a backbuffer and allow continuing, though.

After reactivation, the application will receive a redraw event,
\fBevExpose\fR.
.SH GENERATED EVENTS
The \fBgii_expose_event\fR is used for the \fBevExpose\fR event.
.SH STRUCTURE MEMBERS
The fields describe the region which needs to be redrawn.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBevExpose\fR handling skeleton:

.nb
.nf
ggi_visual_t vis;
ggi_event ev;

/* ... wait and get the event... */

if (ev.any.type == evExpose) {
    /* We might not be able to render partially ... */
    render_screen(vis);
              
    /* but flush only the region needed */
    ggiFlushRegion(vis, ev.expose.x, ev.expose.y,
                        ev.expose.w, ev.expose.h);
}

/* ... etc ... */
